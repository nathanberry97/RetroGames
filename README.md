## Main

To run the program you must run the main file, as the other two python files
just contain classes needed to run the games.
You can run the program with the following command from the terminal:

```console
py Main.py
```

This will lunch the program where you will be able to select which program you
would like to play.

## Snake

Within the Snake file it contains the methods needed to allow the Main.py file
to run the program.
Feel free to add extra logic, would be good if the game dynamically increase 
the snakes speed based upon the score.

## Pong

Within the Pong file it contains the methods needed to allow the Main.py file
to run the program.
Feel free to add extra logic, would be good if you add some form of 
reinforcement learning, so you are able to play against the computer.
